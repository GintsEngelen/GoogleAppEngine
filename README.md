# GoogleAppEngine

This was the final project in our Distributed Systems course. We were tasked with designing the back-end for a Distributed Car Rental Service. 

Most notably, we used the Google Cloud Datastore (no-SQL database) and Task Queues with Workers. 

This was a group project in teams of 2, and all commits were the result of pair-programming sessions between myself and Brecht Philtjens.
